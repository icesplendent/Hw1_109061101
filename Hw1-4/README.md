2. the time unit for input signal is 1s, i.e. Press the button for 1s for `.`, press the button for 3s for `-`
3. once idle after 7s, the output will be shown via seven segment display

## Results

## P.S.
Some letters are hard to display accurately via seven segment display, the corresponding seven segment display pattern of the following letters are defined as below:

`K` would be displayed in the pattern of `H`,\n
`M` would be displayed in the pattern of `3`,\n
`U` would be displayed in the pattern of `U`,\n
`v` would be displayed in the pattern of `u`,\n
